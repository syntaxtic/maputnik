This is a fork of [maputnik/editor](https://github.com/maputnik/editor) which is "An open source visual editor for the 'Mapbox Style Specification'". In this fork, `pmtiles` protocol has been added to `maplibregl` so that the editor should work also with [Protomaps](https://docs.protomaps.com/). Also see [syntaxtic/maputnik-pmtiles-build](https://github.com/syntaxtic/maputnik-pmtiles-build)
